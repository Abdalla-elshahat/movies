          <h3>Where did all of your data come from?</h3>
          <p>You! Since starting this project in 2008, we've been lucky enough to have users just like you add and edit missing/incorrect data. Think of TMDB as a very specialised version of Wikipedia where everything is editable but very specialised around only movie, TV and actor data. We started with an initial data contribution from a project called omdb with only 10,000 movies in 2009. Everything added and edited since then has been users just like you!
In October 2013, we finally added TV. Since we didn't want to start with an empty database we opted to bring an intial import of data from Freebase. Unfortunately, Freebase is no longer online and was shut down in 2016. <a href="#">forums</a>.</p>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>Why can't I find what I am looking for?</h3>
          <p>There are two common scenarios. First, the media has not been added to our database yet. Second, it could be a misspelling, typo, or foreign language issue. Movies and TV shows support translated titles as well as what we call "Alternative Titles". A lot of times the issue is simply that the translated or alternative title hasn't been added.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>Do you have social features?</h3>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>How do you calculate a content score?</h3>
          <p>The content score is calculated with a series of validations we do on movies and TV shows to gauge their completeness. For movies, we check for: a director, a writer, four or more cast members, an overview, a poster, a backdrop, a release date, and a trailer. For TV shows, we check for: a creator, four or more cast members, an overview, a poster, a backdrop, an air date, and genres.</p>
